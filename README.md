# Mikocin responsive web-site

## In this task were used such technologies as flexbox, grid, gulp, scss and npm

## The web-page was optimized by uniting all the icons in one sprite to reduce amount of HTTP requests and minifying source files

## On small screen sizes main background is replaced with its lighter version

### Firstly run 'npm install'

- By default, running 'gulp' will compile scss to css files
- To start 'watch' task run 'gulp watch'
- To minify css and html files run 'gulp build'

### Lighthouse results on desktop (1) and mobile (2) versions:
